jvwp
====

High-level OOP abstractions for commonly used WordPress functionality

* Do you hate the way WordPress relies on a ton of inconsistently named global functions? 
* Are you often repeating the same code over and over to perform trivial tasks such as widget or post type creation? 
* Do you like pizza?

Then **jvwp** might just be the OOP abstraction library for you!

Our readme is still work in progress!
