jvwp
====

High-level OOP abstractions for commonly used WordPress functionality

* Do you hate the way WordPress relies on tons of inconsistently named global functions?
* Do you find yourself writing repetitive code to perform trivial tasks such as widget or post type creation?
* Do you like pizza?

Then **jvwp** might just be for you!
